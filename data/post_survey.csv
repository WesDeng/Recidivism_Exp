By increasing the accuracy, to say 90+ %, both true postive and true negative rates would thus increase and false positive and false negative rates would fall as well.  Though important, decreasing disparity between demographics only applies to demographic related algorithms, or algorithms that incorporate demographic related data.  As the question is in regards to ""any"" algorithm, demographics wouldnt be the main concern as it does not apply to all algorithmic decision making systems.  However, if the algorithmic base decision making system does related to demographics, decreasing disparity between included demographic groups is extremely important.  All bias should be eliminated in this situation.  As indicated in todays exercise, all models had a significant level of disparity between white and black subjects.  This is not appropriate so all efforts should be taken to reduce this metric.","Yes","I had more time to read and consider each point one by one this time. ","6","6","6","6","3a). Judges are more concerned about increasing the overall accuracy of the model.  Lowering both the false positive rate and the false negative rate would ensure that they have a tool to help them make the right decision for both likely and non-likely re-offenders.  However, if given a choice, I'm sure they would want to first lower False Positives as they want to ensure that people are not being punished for crimes that they will not commit.  Letting a guilty person go is better than committing an innocent person for a crime they did not commit.  As a result, they would rather reduce the amount of people mistakenly classified as likely re-offenders than reduce the amount of people presumed innocent.  Of course, this perspective may not be as accurate for judges operating in different political, economical or social climates. With many American jails existing as for-profit entities, judges may swayed to use a model that returns higher false positives as a means to increase prison sentences and the bottom line for prisons.  


3b). From a prisoners perspective, increasing False Negative rate would be the ideal choice as it would increase the likelihood that they would be labelled as non-reoffenders and receive lower sentences or be released earlier.


3c) For a community concerned about re-offending behaviour within the community itself,  they would be more interested in lowering the false negative rate, therefore reducing the amount of likely-reoffenders being released early or receiving shorter sentences than they should have.  This would result in a lower number of re-offenders entering back into the community and potentially commiting more crime.
