analyzing the dataset,,,"So if we were to look at our EAM activity and the instructions, it said that the data set had 3000 people 1063 were charged with another crime within two years and 1937 were not charged with a crime within two years. That is relatively balanced as a data set in my mind.",./Copy of Room 12.docx,Wesley Deng,1
checklist action,checking out a point,," That's what it asked for, though. What are the trade offs between the expected benefits and potential harms for identified stakeholder groups?",./Copy of Room 4.docx,Wesley Deng,7
checklist action,checking out a point,,"I think a good way to make a decision is just following the point three, identifying the state stakeholders by which we can just have a pros and cons or you know the potential benefits and the potential harms for like either of these things if you want to go for like high false negative and high false positive.",./Copy of Room 12.docx,Wesley Deng,17
checklist action,checking out a point,,"sidles societal value means like, the value to the society, right? Or the impact relating to slavery. Yeah. So I think the first question is just asking, what, what do we believe is more important for society? ",./Copy of Room 4.docx,Wesley Deng,3
checklist action,identifying stakeholders,,"Yeah, yeah. criminals and in fact, I think actually the overall the the tax payer you know, they pay the money or the jail right the wholesaler to write to support the criminals. So I think they're like also interactive stakeholders.",./Copy of Room 4.docx,Wesley Deng,5
commenting on the criminal system,innocent till proven guilty,,But I don't know in the American legal system I think false negative rate is considered like you know innocent till proven guilty so hopefully that's a pretty big metric but or false positive,./Copy of Room 13.docx,Wesley Deng,13
common action,commenting on the algorithm's legitimacy,,But I think we need to question what the role of this like this model prediction system is. ,./Copy of Room 12.docx,Wesley Deng,6
common action,commenting on the algorithm's legitimacy,,"Um, so if a person who will not a refund but is predicted to reaffirm or well we put him in to the jail immediately, or we just watch him closely, and depends on what Griffin,",./Copy of Room 12.docx,Wesley Deng,5
common action,commenting on the dataset,bias in data," So right, when they look and when they use their data and the sentences that they're recommending the base off sentences that were already given to people, certain races, genders, ages, etc. ",./Copy of Room 12.docx,Wesley Deng,13
common action,commenting on the dataset,bias in data,"based like is it an institutional bias? Or is it a bias in the data set? You know, like, for example, let's say like for, just as an example, we have 70% white American in the data set and only 30% African American would like data points. ",./Copy of Room 12.docx,Wesley Deng,16
common action,commenting on the dataset,innocent till proven guilty,"I think just to bounce another idea in there, as we talk, the the idea, at least in the United States and serve our society is innocent until proven guilty. ",./Copy of Room 9.docx,Wesley Deng,1
common action,commenting on the dateset,bias in data,just like just to add on one more point is that I think like by definition it says like having a database model or database system is bound to have some biases based on the previous experiences,./Copy of Room 12.docx,Wesley Deng,14
common action,endorsing accuracy,,"If I'm going to these models, I'm gonna start with models that have high accuracy, right?",./Copy of Room 12.docx,Wesley Deng,18
common action,endorsing accuracy,,"Yeah, I'm pretty similar to JT so I picked number three because of its high overall accuracy. Meaning it can predict more accurately, right?",./Copy of Room 4.docx,Wesley Deng,1
common action,personal opinions,,"But of course, there's financial impact because let's say, you know, dad gets convicted of something of something, you know, now now, but mom doesn't work. And my mom can't work.",./Copy of Room 4.docx,Wesley Deng,6
common action,understanding terminology,,positive is the fraction of people who are falsely predicted to reaffirm false positive people are not going to refund but have been labeled as offenders of future offenders.,./Copy of Room 4.docx,Wesley Deng,4
compromising,other people's perspective,,"Um, I mean, like, I think like, we should all consider other people's perspectives, as well as a defendant will also consider or what is good for the entire society. ",./Copy of Room 13.docx,Wesley Deng,14
eliminating models,,,"get rid of either model for model two, which one would you guys get rid of",./Copy of Room 13.docx,Wesley Deng,16
endorsing a metric,,,"So, I think accuracy here actually means something.",./Copy of Room 12.docx,Wesley Deng,2
endorsing a metric,,,o like champion for model number five because like it has the lowest false positive rate of just 1.9%,./Copy of Room 12.docx,Wesley Deng,4
metric action,critical thinking,," But, I mean, I don't know if this is like part of the model or like the part of the system like that we're supposed to discuss, but there could be like alternative measures, which could be in place to just try to stop crime or like prevent crimes separately from the model,",./Copy of Room 12.docx,Wesley Deng,8
metric action,critical thinking,,"Because if we just think 18% is not a big number, but that is the difference between two groups. So yeah, if we consider is the difference between two groups. 18% is a large number.",./Copy of Room 9.docx,Wesley Deng,5
metric action,critical thinking,,"Model three is 5%. So there's about the same amount of 104 is the best disparity but it's got both positive and negative disparities really high from all five. It's about 5% of the model six to 7% from all seven Well 3.5 from on late. So that's kind of goes back to my point about how distinguishable like is that statistically significant, those differences in disparity there absolutely there, but it's whereas the false positive rates like 4% versus 30%. That's clearly a big, big difference. You know, I think I do think disparity matters, but maybe model three only has a 5% disparity",./Copy of Room 9.docx,Wesley Deng,4
metric action,degrading a metric,accuracy,"so actually, I think like accuracy is probably not Good metrics in every cases, I would agree there is still like a bias in the training data set.",./Copy of Room 13.docx,Wesley Deng,9
metric action,degrading a metric,fnr," false negative rate. To me, I didn't really care about that, because I actually went don't want to go back to jail.",./Copy of Room 13.docx,Wesley Deng,5
metric action,degrading a metric,fpr,"And and if we think they mean if we force the thing of people who won't re offend, if they sit in jail a little bit longer, I don't think they'll get corrupted enough to go out and offend later. Somore concerned with false negatives",./Copy of Room 4.docx,Wesley Deng,2
metric action,endorsing a metric,,I would say that a good model would be one that has high overall accuracy and minimal disparity between races.,./Copy of Room 12.docx,Wesley Deng,15
metric action,metric conflicting,fpr vs  fnr,I think it's liketo choose between a high false positive rate and a high false negative. But I mean number four is like the most balanced one,./Copy of Room 1.docx,Wesley Deng,1
metric conflicting,,,"even though we have an accuracy, which is really high, and like that's really good, and like absolute terms, it's like it has an accuracy of 70% but the false positive rates would be 10%.",./Copy of Room 12.docx,Wesley Deng,3

model action,overlapping model,,"if you look at three and four and just kind of click back to between the two, I guess I'm a little For us in terms of the disparity because the summary card says disparity is better for four than for three, but it doesn't seem like it's really much and is that statistically significant",./Copy of Room 9.docx,Wesley Deng,3
model action,picking out candidates,,"If we look at that comparison slide at the end,kind of the two models are kind of satisfice. where, you know, there's not too much false positivity and not too much false negativity.",./Copy of Room 9.docx,Wesley Deng,2

persona action,emphasizing persona's value,,"I'm good with that, you know, because they both have low positive rates. And that was both my choices.",./Copy of Room 13.docx,Wesley Deng,11
persona action,emphasizing persona's value,community member,"I will say if my only goal if I only have one goal and that goal is to reduce the false negative rate, then I would choose model eight. Before more balanced model, I would probably choose model two.",./Copy of Room 13.docx,Wesley Deng,2
